[CEEMID](www.ceemid.eu) is an Entertainment & Media Industry database covering Central Europe in particular and whole Europe for comparative purposes.  CEEMID  started as a collaboration of authorsâ€™ societies and Candole Partners in the region for measuring and reporting economic value added, contribution to national income and employment in the music industry with a creative industries perspective. Following a general creative industry perspective, we are now covering data about the music industry (live performances and sound recordings), the film industry (motion film production, trade, theatrical release), television and radio broadcasting, book and newpaper publishing and theatrical performances.
